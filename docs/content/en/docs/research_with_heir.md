## Doing private research using HEIR

Our project will be developed in an open-source GitHub repository. If you'd like
to work on a non-public branch while still accessing the latest developments, we
recommend the following setup. This process will result in two remote
repositories: one public for submitting pull requests (PRs) to the original repo
and one private.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the
   [google/heir](https://github.com/google/heir) repo to a public fork on your
   GitHub repository. This should create a project at
   `https://github.com/<username>/heir`

1. **Create a Private Repository**: Create a new private repo using the
   [GitHub UI](https://github.com/new), e.g. named `heir-private`

1. **Link Your Fork to the Private Repository** Couple your fork to the new
   private repo

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:<username>/heir.git heir-public
cd heir-public
git push --mirror git@github.com:<username>/heir-private.git
cd ..
rm -rf heir-public
```

4. **Clone the Private Repository** Now, you can clone the private repo to work
   locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/heir-private.git
cd heir-private
```

5. **Add the Private Repository as a Remote to Your Public Repository**
   Additionally, you can add the private repo as a remote target to your public
   repo. This way, the private branch will be locally available, while you can
   push commits to the private repo.

```bash
cd heir
git remote add private git@github.com:<username>/heir-private.git
git fetch --all
git checkout private/new_branch
```

Note that using `git push private new_branch2` will push the commit/branch to
the private repo.

Once you're ready to publish your development work, you can push your commits to
a branch in the public repository and create a pull request.
